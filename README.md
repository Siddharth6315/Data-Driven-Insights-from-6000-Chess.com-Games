# Data-Driven-Insights-from-6000-Chess.com-Games
This project analyzes my personal dataset of ~6000 chess games played on Chess.com  using Python. The data was fetched through the official Chess.com API and cleaned with pandas for deeper exploration.  The goal of this project is to practice data analysis and visualization while uncovering meaningful insights about my chess performance.
