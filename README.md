# Data-Driven-Insights-from-6000-Chess.com-Games
This project analyzes my personal dataset of ~6500 chess games played on Chess.com  using Python. The data was fetched through the official Chess.com API and cleaned with pandas for deeper exploration.  The goal of this project is to practice data analysis and visualization while uncovering meaningful insights about my chess performance.

# Key Features
1.Extracted game archives using Chess.com public API (requests)<br>
2.Cleaned and structured raw JSON data into a tabular format with pandas<br>
3.Explored player performance across time controls (bullet, blitz, rapid)<br>
4.Compared accuracy, win/loss ratios, and rating progression over time<br>
5.Visualized insights using matplotlib & seaborn<br>
6.(Future work) Analyze openings from PGN files and evaluate performance trends<br>
# Skills & Tools
1.Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn)<br>
2.API data fetching (requests)<br>
3.Data cleaning & preprocessing<br>
4.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)<br>
5.Visualization & storytelling with data<br>
